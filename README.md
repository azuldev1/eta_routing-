Copy to desktop. Open in Webstorm. Run NPM INSTALL in the command line.
 I got cat names to submit and who show up on the screen. I could'nt figure out how to
 clear the form after submit.
 Also I'm not fully understanding services vs providers vs factory?
 How would I do this placing the the get and put requests in different controllers?
 How would I give access to a function that's in a different controller?
 Would I write a service to give the submit control access to a get method function()?
